1/34: RAM
what is a data structure?
bits -> byte -> RAM --> Data Structures 

2/34:Static array
properties of arrays
use indexes to access values 
address -> read the value at that address 

efficient operation => O(1) => big O of 1

random access memory, randomly access any portion of memory in constant time 

you can't deallocate a value in a static array
what you're doing is overwriting the value 

3/34 Dynamic arrays
more common, more useful 
amortized time complexity -- ?

4/34: Stack
Dynamic arrays implementation -> Stack 

5/32
Connected via pointers 
Order in memory can be mess
Not stored same in memory
